This plugin adds a new tab to the category boxes on admin add / edit pages.

== Description ==

This tab has a simple field in which you can enter a keyword and the list is filtered by this keyword.

Simple as the sun, using easy JS.

Especially useful when there are a lot of categories, like in case of a shop.

It needs jQuery to run !
